# PyTorch learning
Contains notebooks with re-usable PyTorch code for beginners.  
Will keep adding over time.

## To do:
  - tensorboard
  - Fashion MNIST
  - language model
  - Transfer learning
  - Cyclic learning rates
  - Learning rate finder
  - Batch normalisation
  - Explore the use of [ignite](https://pytorch.org/ignite/) library.
  - Implement simple matrix factorisation collaborative filter ([this notebook](https://github.com/jsleroux/Recommender-Systems/blob/master/Pytorch%20and%20Recommender%20Systems.ipynb) looks like it could provide the answer)
